**Currently this project is a work-in-progress and is the main project I am developing as of 09/05/2024. The contents in this README may be outdated.**

**Many of what I have listed are things that I have already covered**

# Project Purpose
Personal project that I created alongside a UDemy course called "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter" made by Stephen Ulibarri.

Largest reason I decided to take the course is to learn about Multiplayer and how games in Unreal can be developed when including Multiplayer.

# Project Takeaways
In this course, I learned new topics that broadened my skill set with Unreal Engine and C++. Some of these topics include:
- Creating a plugin
- Setting up Networking/Multiplayer through Steam, including hosting and joining game sessions
- Replicating data for multiplayer using RPCs and OnRep functions
- Using game states for player information
- many more...

*_The topics listed are what I have currently covered as of Sep. 5, 2024_

# Personal Additions
In addition to the topics I learned through the course, I added my own additions to try my hand at applying what I have learned.

Here are a few things I added that were not done as part of the course:
- Displayed player names above their character

# Project Showcase

## Multiplayer Plugin
