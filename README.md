# Project Purpose
Personal project that I created alongside a UDemy course called "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter" made by Stephen Ulibarri.

Largest reason I decided to take the course is to learn about Multiplayer and how games in Unreal can be developed when including Multiplayer.

## Project Takeaways
In this course, I learned new topics that broadened my skill set with Unreal Engine and C++. Some of these topics include:
- Creating a plugin
- Setting up Networking/Multiplayer
- Developing a game based on a listen server
- Replicating data for multiplayer
- Using RPCs to sync client changes to server
- Using game states for player information
- many more...

## Personal Additions
In addition to the topics I learned through the course, I added my own additions to try my hand at applying what I have learned.

Here are a few things I added that were not done as part of the course:
- Displayed player names above their character

Here is a more in-depth look at what I added myself and some media to show it.
